    echo "⚠️ Performance regression detected"
    echo "Current: ${CURRENT_TIME}s vs Baseline: ${BASELINE_TIME}s"
    echo "Degradation: $(calculate_degradation)%"
fi

    # Alert on consistent performance decline
}
```

### Alert System

```bash
# Performance alert thresholds
UNIT_TEST_ALERT_THRESHOLD=15        # 15 seconds
INTEGRATION_ALERT_THRESHOLD=60      # 60 seconds  
DEGRADATION_ALERT_THRESHOLD=50      # 50% degradation

# Alert mechanisms

```

### Recovery Procedures
Systematic approach to performance issues:

```bash
# Performance issue investigation
1. Check cache integrity: ./scripts/cache-manager.sh verify
2. Clean corrupted cache: ./scripts/cache-manager.sh clean  
3. Verify test infrastructure: ./test-unit.sh --verify
4. Check system resources: disk space, memory, network
5. Compare against known good baseline
6. Analyze performance report for bottlenecks
```

## Performance Optimization Recommendations

### Automated Analysis
The performance measurement system provides automated recommendations:

```bash
# Performance analysis output
What Worked Well:
✅ Mock provider implementation eliminated ML initialization overhead
✅ Test suite separation allowed targeted test execution  
✅ Model caching reduced redundant downloads significantly
✅ MLX conditional loading improved startup time

Areas for Further Improvement:
⚠️ Unit tests exceeding 10s target - consider parallel execution
⚠️ Cache restoration taking >30s - optimize disk I/O
⚠️ Memory usage growing over time - investigate memory leaks

Recommended Next Steps:
1. Implement parallel test execution for unit tests
2. Optimize cache restoration with compression
3. Add memory usage monitoring and cleanup
4. Consider SSD storage for cache performance
```

### Performance Tuning Guidelines

#### For Development Environments
```bash
# Optimize for developer productivity
- Prioritize unit test speed over integration test comprehensiveness
- Use smaller cache limits (1-2GB) to preserve disk space
- Enable performance monitoring for regression detection
- Focus on fast feedback loops and iteration speed
```

#### For CI/CD Environments  
```bash
# Optimize for comprehensive validation
- Allocate generous cache storage (5GB+) for hit rate optimization
- Use parallel test execution where possible
- Implement cache warm-up steps in CI pipeline
- Monitor performance trends across builds
```

#### For Production Validation
```bash
# Optimize for reliability and coverage

## Troubleshooting Performance Issues

### Common Performance Problems

#### Slow Unit Tests
**Symptoms**: Unit tests taking >30 seconds
**Investigation**:
```bash
# Check if mock providers are being used
echo $VOCORIZE_TEST_MODE  # Should be 'unit'

# Verify mock provider selection
./test-unit.sh --debug

# Check for real provider usage in unit tests
grep -r "WhisperKit" VocorizeTests/ --include="*Tests.swift"
```

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Force unit test mode
export VOCORIZE_TEST_MODE=unit

# Verify mock provider configuration
# Check TestProviderFactory.swift for proper mock selection
# Review test code for hardcoded real provider usage
```

#### Cache Performance Issues
**Symptoms**: Integration tests slow despite cache presence
**Investigation**:
```bash
# Check cache status and integrity
./scripts/cache-manager.sh verify

# Analyze cache hit/miss patterns  
./test-integration.sh --cache-info

# Check available disk space and I/O performance
df -h
iostat -x 1 5
```

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Clean corrupted cache
./scripts/cache-manager.sh clean

# Optimize cache storage
./scripts/cache-manager.sh optimize

# Move cache to faster storage (SSD)
# Increase cache size limits if storage allows
```

#### Memory Performance Issues
**Symptoms**: High memory usage, system slowdown
**Investigation**:
```bash
# Monitor memory usage during tests
top -o MEM

# Check for memory leaks in test infrastructure
instruments -t Leaks ./test-integration.sh

# Analyze memory growth patterns
./performance-measurement.sh --memory-focus
```

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Implement memory cleanup in tests
# Reduce concurrent test execution
# Optimize mock provider memory usage
# Add memory usage monitoring and limits
```
