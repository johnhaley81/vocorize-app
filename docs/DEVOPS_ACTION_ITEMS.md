# DevOps Action Items for PR #17 - WhisperKit Provider Architecture

## BLOCKING ISSUES (Must be resolved before merge approval)

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline Establishment ‚ùå **CRITICAL**
**Issue**: No automated CI/CD workflows detected. Manual testing only.
**Impact**: Cannot validate provider architecture changes automatically.
**Requirements**:
- [x] Create GitHub Actions workflow for CI (`/.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- [ ] Fix code signing configuration for test execution
- [ ] Set up automated testing on PR branches
- [ ] Add code quality gates (SwiftLint, security scanning)

**Action**: 
```bash
# Fix signing for CI
security create-keychain -p "" ci-keychain
security set-keychain-settings ci-keychain
# Import development certificate (requires manual setup)
```

### 2. Code Signing Resolution ‚ùå **CRITICAL**
**Issue**: `No signing certificate "Mac Development" found: No "Mac Development" signing certificate matching team ID "QC99C9JE59"`
**Impact**: Test suite cannot execute, blocking validation of 118+ test cases.
**Requirements**:
- [ ] Install development certificate for team ID QC99C9JE59
- [ ] Configure CI to skip code signing for testing
- [ ] Update build scripts to handle CI environments

**Action**:
```bash
# For CI environment
CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="" CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

### 3. Model Storage & Distribution Strategy ‚ùå **CRITICAL**
**Issue**: Large ML models (100MB-1.5GB) with no proper distribution strategy.
**Impact**: Provider switching may fail due to missing models.
**Requirements**:
- [ ] Implement model caching strategy
- [ ] Add model download failure handling
- [ ] Create model versioning for compatibility
- [ ] Set up CDN for model distribution (optional)

## HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES (Should be addressed before production deployment)

### 4. Monitoring & Observability ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH**
**Issue**: No monitoring for provider performance, model loading, or failure rates.
**Impact**: Cannot detect issues in production or optimize performance.
**Requirements**:
- [x] Create monitoring strategy document (`/docs/MONITORING.md`)
- [ ] Implement basic performance logging
- [ ] Add error tracking for provider failures
- [ ] Set up alerts for critical failures

### 5. Dependency Stability ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH**
**Issue**: WhisperKit tracks `main` branch instead of stable release.
**Impact**: Unstable dependency could break production builds.
**Requirements**:
- [ ] Pin WhisperKit to stable version/tag
- [ ] Add dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Document dependency update policy

### 6. Provider Testing Coverage ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH**
**Issue**: New provider architecture lacks comprehensive integration testing.
**Impact**: Provider switching or model routing could fail silently.
**Requirements**:
- [x] Create provider architecture validation workflow
- [ ] Add integration tests for provider factory
- [ ] Test model routing for all models in models.json
- [ ] Add performance regression tests

## MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES (Recommended improvements)

### 7. Storage Management ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM**
**Issue**: No automated cleanup for downloaded models.
**Impact**: Storage usage could grow unbounded.
**Requirements**:
- [ ] Implement model cleanup strategy
- [ ] Add storage usage monitoring
- [ ] Create storage quota management

### 8. Error Recovery ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM**
**Issue**: Limited fallback strategies for provider failures.
**Impact**: App could become unusable if preferred provider fails.
**Requirements**:
- [ ] Implement provider fallback logic
- [ ] Add graceful degradation for model loading failures
- [ ] Create user-facing error messages

### 9. Performance Optimization ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM**
**Issue**: No performance baselines for provider comparison.
**Impact**: Cannot optimize provider selection or model routing.
**Requirements**:
- [ ] Establish performance baselines
- [ ] Add provider performance comparison metrics
- [ ] Implement adaptive provider selection

## IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE

### Phase 1: Critical Infrastructure (Week 1)
1. **Fix code signing for CI** - Enable test execution
2. **Set up basic CI/CD pipeline** - Automated testing on PRs
3. **Implement model download error handling** - Prevent provider failures

### Phase 2: Monitoring & Safety (Week 2)
1. **Add basic performance logging** - Track provider metrics
2. **Create deployment safety checks** - Prevent regression
3. **Set up dependency scanning** - Security validation

### Phase 3: Optimization & Reliability (Week 3-4)
1. **Implement provider fallback logic** - Improve reliability
2. **Add storage management** - Prevent storage issues
3. **Performance optimization** - Optimize provider selection

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before approving PR #17, verify:

- [ ] **CI Pipeline**: All tests pass in automated environment
- [ ] **Code Signing**: Tests execute without certificate errors
- [ ] **Provider Tests**: All provider implementations have test coverage
- [ ] **Model Routing**: Factory correctly routes all models from models.json
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Provider failures handled gracefully
- [ ] **Memory Management**: No memory leaks in provider switching
- [ ] **Storage Impact**: Model storage strategy documented and tested
- [ ] **Performance**: No regression in transcription speed/accuracy
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Basic metrics collection implemented
- [ ] **Documentation**: Architecture changes documented

## DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

### Pre-Deployment
1. **Canary Testing**: Deploy to limited beta users first
2. **Performance Baseline**: Establish metrics before rollout
3. **Rollback Plan**: Test rollback procedure

### Deployment
1. **Staged Rollout**: 10% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100% user rollout
2. **Monitoring**: Watch provider performance metrics
3. **Error Tracking**: Monitor for increased failure rates

### Post-Deployment
1. **Performance Analysis**: Compare against baseline
2. **User Feedback**: Collect feedback on provider performance
3. **Optimization**: Tune provider selection based on metrics

## RISK MITIGATION

### High-Risk Changes
- **Provider Factory Pattern**: New singleton actor pattern
- **Model Routing Logic**: Could misdirect transcription requests
- **Memory Management**: Large models in actor-based system

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit + integration + performance tests
- **Gradual Rollout**: Staged deployment with monitoring
- **Quick Rollback**: Simple revert strategy for critical issues
- **User Communication**: Clear messaging about architecture improvements
