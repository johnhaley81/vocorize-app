     * ALL TESTS BELOW ARE COMMENTED OUT FOR TDD RED PHASE

     * These tests are designed to fail because:
     * - MLXIntegrationChecker class doesn't exist yet
     * - MLX Swift package is not yet integrated
     * - MLX build settings are not configured
     * - MLX linking and compilation settings don't exist
     * 
     * TO RE-ENABLE:
     * 1. Add MLX Swift package to the project
     * 2. Implement MLXIntegrationChecker class
     * 3. Configure MLX build settings
     * 4. Set up MLX linking and compilation
     * 5. Uncomment the tests below
     * 6. Remove the placeholder test above
