# Integration Test Model Caching System

This document describes the intelligent model caching system implemented for Vocorize integration tests, designed to reduce test execution times from 5-30 minutes to under 30 seconds on cache hits.

## Overview

The model caching system addresses the primary bottleneck in integration tests: downloading large ML models (100MB - 1.5GB) from HuggingFace Hub. By intelligently caching downloaded models and reusing them across test runs, the system provides:

- **Performance**: 5-25 minute time savings per test run
- **Reliability**: Reduced dependency on network connectivity
- **CI/CD Efficiency**: Faster feedback loops for developers
- **Cost Optimization**: Reduced bandwidth usage in CI environments

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. ModelCacheManager
**Location**: `VocorizeTests/Support/ModelCacheManager.swift`

The central caching engine that provides:
- Model storage and retrieval
- Cache validation with checksums
- Automatic cleanup and optimization
- Storage efficiency with configurable limits
- Thread-safe operations with Swift's actor model

#### 2. CachedWhisperKitProvider
**Location**: `VocorizeTests/Support/TestProviderFactory.swift`

A wrapper around WhisperKit that provides:
- Transparent cache integration
- Model restoration from cache
- Fallback to original download behavior
- Progress reporting for both cached and downloaded models

#### 3. TestProviderFactory Integration
Enhanced to support:
- Cache-aware provider creation
- Cache warming utilities
- Statistics tracking and reporting

### Cache Storage Strategy

#### Storage Locations
- **Vocorize Test Cache**: `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/VocorizeTests/ModelCache/`
- **HuggingFace Cache**: `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/` (preserved for compatibility)

#### Cache Structure
```
ModelCache/
├── cache_metadata.json          # Model metadata and checksums
├── openai_whisper-tiny          # Cached model (uncompressed)
├── openai_whisper-base          # Cached model (uncompressed)
└── openai_whisper-small.tar.gz  # Cached model (compressed, future)
```

#### Metadata Format
```json
[
  {
    "modelName": "openai_whisper-tiny",
    "originalURL": "file:///path/to/original",
    "checksum": "sha256_hash",
    "cachedDate": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "lastAccessDate": "2024-01-15T15:45:00Z",
    "size": 104857600,
    "version": "1.0",
    "isCompressed": false
  }
]
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Cache Hit Performance
- **Model Lookup**: < 1 second
- **Model Restoration**: 5-30 seconds (depending on model size)
- **Total Test Time**: 30 seconds - 2 minutes

### Cache Miss Performance
- **Model Download**: 2-15 minutes (network dependent)
- **Model Caching**: 10-60 seconds (I/O dependent)
- **Total Test Time**: Same as original + caching overhead

### Cache Efficiency
- **Hit Rate Target**: > 80% for repeated test runs
- **Storage Limit**: 2GB default (configurable)
- **Cleanup Policy**: LRU eviction when limit exceeded
- **Expiration**: 7 days default (configurable)

## Integration Points

### Test Integration
Integration tests automatically use cached models through the updated test infrastructure:

```swift
// Old approach
let provider = WhisperKitProvider()

// New cached approach  
let provider = TestProviderFactory.createProvider(for: .whisperKit)
```

### Cache Management
Tests automatically handle:
- Cache warming during initialization
- Model validation before use
- Cache optimization after test completion
- Statistics tracking for performance monitoring

### CI/CD Integration
The caching system works seamlessly in CI/CD environments:
- Cache directories are preserved between builds when possible
- Cache warm-up can be done as a pre-build step
- Cache statistics help monitor CI performance

## Usage

### Running Integration Tests
The caching system is transparent to test execution:

```bash
# Standard integration tests (uses caching automatically)
./test-integration.sh

# Force clean cache for troubleshooting
./test-integration.sh --clean-cache

# Show cache information
./test-integration.sh --cache-info
```

### Cache Management
Use the dedicated cache manager for maintenance:

```bash
# Show cache status
scripts/cache-manager.sh status

# Clean all caches
scripts/cache-manager.sh clean

# Verify cache integrity
scripts/cache-manager.sh verify

# Optimize cache (cleanup temp files)
scripts/cache-manager.sh optimize
```

### Performance Demonstration
Run the cache performance demo to see the system in action:

```bash
# Demonstrate cache performance improvement
./test-cache-demo.sh
```

## Configuration

### Default Configuration
```swift
CacheConfiguration(
    maxCacheSize: 2_147_483_648,    // 2GB
    maxAge: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60,       // 7 days
    enableCompression: false         // Future feature
)
```

### Environment Variables
- `VOCORIZE_TEST_MODE=integration`: Enable integration test mode
- `VOCORIZE_CACHE_DIR`: Override cache directory location

### Customization Options
The cache can be configured for different environments:

```swift
// Larger cache for CI environments
let ciConfig = CacheConfiguration(
    maxCacheSize: 5_368_709_120,    // 5GB
    maxAge: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60       // 30 days
)

// Smaller cache for developer machines
let devConfig = CacheConfiguration(
    maxCacheSize: 1_073_741_824,    // 1GB
    maxAge: 3 * 24 * 60 * 60        // 3 days
)
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Cache Statistics
The system provides comprehensive statistics:
- Total cache size and model count
- Hit/miss ratios
- Cache age information
- Available disk space
- Model access patterns

### Performance Monitoring
Built-in performance tracking includes:
- Cache lookup times
- Model restoration times
- Download vs. cache comparison
- Storage efficiency metrics

### Debug Information
Detailed logging shows:
- Cache hit/miss decisions
- Model validation results
- Storage operations
- Cleanup activities

Example debug output:
```
🎯 Cache HIT: openai_whisper-tiny (age: 2h 15m)
💾 Caching model: openai_whisper-base
🗑️ Removed expired model: openai_whisper-small (age: 8d 3h)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Cache Misses Despite Downloaded Models
**Symptoms**: Tests still download models even though they exist
**Cause**: Cache metadata corruption or checksum mismatch
**Solution**: 
```bash
scripts/cache-manager.sh verify
scripts/cache-manager.sh clean  # if verification fails
```

#### Slow Cache Restoration
**Symptoms**: Cache hits are still slow (>2 minutes)
**Cause**: Large models or slow disk I/O
**Solution**: Check available disk space and consider SSD storage

#### Cache Size Growing Too Large
**Symptoms**: Cache exceeds configured limits
**Cause**: Cleanup not running or too many cached models
**Solution**:
```bash
scripts/cache-manager.sh optimize
./test-integration.sh  # Triggers automatic cleanup
```

### Performance Optimization

#### For Developers
- Keep cache under 2GB for local development
- Run cache cleanup weekly: `scripts/cache-manager.sh clean`
- Use cache-info to monitor storage usage

#### For CI/CD
- Allocate 5GB+ for cache storage
- Preserve cache between builds when possible
- Monitor cache hit rates in CI logs
- Use warm-cache steps before test execution

### Recovery Procedures

#### Complete Cache Reset
```bash
# Nuclear option: clear everything and start fresh
scripts/cache-manager.sh clean
./test-integration.sh --clean-cache
```

#### Selective Model Cleanup
```swift
// Remove specific models programmatically
let cache = ModelCacheManager()
try await cache.removeCachedModel("problematic_model_name")
```

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow
1. **First Run**: Let tests cache models naturally
2. **Subsequent Runs**: Benefit from cached models automatically
3. **Weekly Maintenance**: Check cache status and cleanup if needed
4. **Before Releases**: Run full integration tests with cold cache

### CI/CD Strategy
1. **Cache Persistence**: Configure CI to preserve cache between builds
2. **Cache Warming**: Pre-download common models as build step
3. **Monitoring**: Track cache hit rates and performance metrics
4. **Cleanup Automation**: Schedule periodic cache cleanup

### Storage Management
1. **Monitor Usage**: Regular cache size checks
2. **Adjust Limits**: Tune cache size based on available storage
3. **Cleanup Scheduling**: Automate expired model removal
4. **Backup Strategy**: Consider backing up cache for critical CI environments

## Future Enhancements
