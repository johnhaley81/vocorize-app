# Task Completion Requirements for Vocorize

## Code Quality Checks

### Required Before Completing Any Task
1. **SwiftLint Check**
   ```bash
   swiftlint
   ```
   - Must pass without errors
   - Warnings should be addressed when reasonable
   - Use `swiftlint --fix` for auto-fixable issues

2. **Build Verification**
   ```bash
   xcodebuild -scheme Vocorize -configuration Release
   ```
   - Code must compile without errors
   - Warnings should be minimal and justified

3. **Test Execution**
   ```bash
   xcodebuild test -scheme Vocorize
   ```
   - All existing tests must pass
   - New functionality should include appropriate tests
   - Use Swift Testing framework (`@Test` and `#expect`)

## Code Review Checklist

### Architecture Compliance
- [ ] Follows TCA patterns for state management
- [ ] Uses dependency injection via `@Dependencies`

- [ ] Consistent naming conventions

## Git and Version Control

### Commit Requirements
- [ ] Descriptive commit messages using conventional format
- [ ] Atomic commits (one logical change per commit)
- [ ] Clean commit history (squash if necessary)
- [ ] All changes staged and committed

### Branch Management
- [ ] Working on appropriate feature/fix branch
- [ ] Based off latest main/develop branch
- [ ] No merge conflicts
- [ ] Ready for merge request if needed

## Platform Compatibility

### Xcode Version
- [ ] Built and tested with Xcode 15.x
